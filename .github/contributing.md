# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to [neo-ltex].

Our objective is to provide language tools to IDEs such as Visual Studio Code.

The [original LTeX - LanguageTool][valentjn.vscode-ltex] created by [Julian Valentin][valentjn] is [apparently abandoned][valentjn-497].

This organization is created to continue the maintenance and development of this system.

[LTeX - LanguageTool][valentjn.vscode-ltex] was based off of [LanguageTool for Visual Studio Code extension][vscode-languagetool] by [Adam Voss<sup>â€ </sup>](https://github.com/adamvoss) who passed away on 7/11/2018.

## How to Set Up the Project
